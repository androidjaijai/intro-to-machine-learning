# Intro to Machine Learning in Python

This guide shows the basics of machine learning using Python. Note that this is shamelessly inspired by/adapted from [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview).

The guide is presented as a Jupyter Notebook [here](./Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20Python.ipynb).
